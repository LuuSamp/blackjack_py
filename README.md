# BLACKJACK_PY

A simple game of blackjack done to practice OOP in Python! The idea was given by my roommate, who made [his own version][1].

## How to Play
- The program needs to be executed on a terminal through Python's Interpreter
- After executing, the game will ask how many players will be playing. Insert an integer. It is not recommended to have more than 10 players.
- Insert the name of each player when the program asks for them.
- After starting, the game will ask player 1 if they want to Draw a card, and move to the next player when the answer is given. 
- When a player answers with N (No), they are considered out of game and will be out of the loop, but their total score will remain.
- When a player's score is above 21, they are considered *exceeded*. They will be out of game and their score will be ignored when calculating the winner.
